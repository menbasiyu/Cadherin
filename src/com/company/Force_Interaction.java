/**
 * Here this module is to achieve the force interaction between these two layers of Cadherin.
 * But, firstly, I need to solve and figure out some important problems. Also todo in this part
 * Q1: how do we evaluate if there is a bond between two bead of cadherin (distance / probability to form?) what
 * metrics?
 * Q2: if they form the bond, do we still to have the k_it to calculate the force to update the position of bead?
 * bond type?
 * Q3: after form the bond, will the effect of thermal force getting smaller? we should update the position in
 * next timestep.
 * todo: (1) find if there is the number of k_it when form the bond
 * todo: (2) read the computational paper!
