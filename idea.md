## All parameters used in this Cadherin Project

1. parallel surface distance ~ 20 nm [ref: A computational Model for Kinetic Studies of Cadherin Binding and Clustering]

2. I found two values of diffusion coefficient in two different papers, we need to figure out which one to use

   a. $28 \times 10^{-3} \mu m^2/s$ [ref: same as the first one]

   b. $3 \times \mu m^2/s$ [ref: Cadherin diffusion in suppoted lipid bilayers exhitis calcium-dependent dynamic heterogenity] this value changes with the concentration of calcium, maybe we can model this

3. cadherin surface density ~ $21 mol/\mu m^2$ [same as the first one] I am not sure if this number is reasonable, can we find other values.
4. all kinetics parameters can be found the fcomputational paper. 



### ideas

1. we may add the fluctuation of cell surface in the model ? 
2. we may create the connection between the concentation of calcium and diffusion of cadherin?
3. we may consider the effect of the actin cytoskeletal movement with the cadherin clustering.
