Cell-Cell Adhesion
Here is the project of modelling the cell-cell adhesion through Cadherin

1. After testing different timesteps, I choose to use the timestep = 1e-5 s. This can put all rate constant into
a reasonable range to indicate the probability of change of the states.
2. still we apply the cut-off distance as 1.5 nm if the distance less than 1,5 then it will form x-dimer or s-dimer 
accordingly to the probability?  [still feel this part is not clear!]
